# WACC (Web Assembly Candy Crush)
Little browser game written in c and compiled with llvm to webassembly.

## Getting started
To build WACC you need clang or llvm and it's linker wasm-ld installed (see Makefile).

`make all-clang`

## TODO
 - Spawn multiple bricks if there's a big hole
 - More particles
 - Combos
